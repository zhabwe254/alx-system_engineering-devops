Postmortem Report for web debugging 2

Issue Summary:

Duration of the Outage: March 15, 2022, from 14:30 UTC to 16:15 UTC.
Impact: The web application experienced an outage lasting approximately 1 hour and 45 minutes, affecting 100% of users. Users encountered 502 Bad Gateway errors when attempting to access the application.
Root Cause: A misconfiguration in the Nginx reverse proxy resulted in the failure to route requests to the application servers.
Timeline:

14:30 UTC - Issue Detected: The monitoring system alerted the on-call engineer to a spike in 502 Bad Gateway errors.
14:35 UTC - Initial Investigation: The on-call engineer began investigating by checking Nginx and application server logs.
14:45 UTC - Misleading Investigation: Suspecting issues with application servers, the engineer attempted restarts, but the problem persisted.
14:55 UTC - Escalation: The issue was escalated to the senior engineer on duty.
15:00 UTC - Root Cause Identified: The senior engineer identified the misconfiguration in the Nginx reverse proxy.
15:45 UTC - Issue Resolved: The senior engineer fixed the misconfiguration, restoring access to the web application.
Root Cause and Resolution:

Root Cause: The Nginx reverse proxy was misconfigured with an incorrect upstream server block, leading to failure in routing requests to application servers, resulting in 502 Bad Gateway errors.
Resolution: The senior engineer corrected the misconfiguration in the Nginx reverse proxy, enabling proper routing of requests to application servers.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Corrective Measures:
Updated Nginx Configuration Documentation: The documentation was reviewed and revised to prevent similar misconfigurations in the future.
Implemented Additional Monitoring on Nginx Reverse Proxy: Monitoring was set up to detect and alert on Nginx issues promptly.
Preventative Measures:
Scheduled Regular Code Reviews of Nginx Configuration: Regular code reviews were established to catch potential issues before they cause outages.
Provided Additional Training to Engineers: Training sessions on Nginx configuration and troubleshooting were conducted to enhance skills and awareness.
Lessons Learned:

Communication: Clear and timely communication between team members is crucial during incident resolution.
Monitoring: Effective monitoring systems can help detect and alert on issues promptly, reducing the mean time to recovery.
Documentation: Proper documentation of configurations and procedures can prevent misconfigurations and simplify troubleshooting.
