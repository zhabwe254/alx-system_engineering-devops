Task 1: Distributed Web Infrastructure

Description:
This project implements a distributed web infrastructure for www.foobar.com.

Components:
- 2 servers
- 1 web server (Nginx)
- 1 application server
- 1 load balancer (HAproxy)
- 1 set of application files (code base)
- 1 database (MySQL)

Explanations:
- **Server 1**: Hosts web server, application server, and load balancer.
- **Server 2**: Hosts application server and database.
- **Web Server (Nginx)**: Handles HTTP requests and serves static content.
- **Application Server**: Executes dynamic code.
- **Load Balancer (HAproxy)**: Distributes traffic across servers.
- **Database (MySQL)**: Primary-Replica cluster for data redundancy.

Issues:
- Single Point of Failure (SPOF)
- Lack of security measures (no firewall, no HTTPS)
- Absence of monitoring
