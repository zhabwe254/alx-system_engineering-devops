Task 2: Secured and Monitored Web Infrastructure

Description:
This project implements a secured, encrypted, and monitored web infrastructure for
www.foobar.com.

Components:
- 3 firewalls
- 1 SSL certificate for HTTPS
- 3 monitoring clients (e.g., Sumologic)

Explanations:
- **Firewalls**: Provide network security.
- **SSL Certificate**: Enables HTTPS for secure, encrypted traffic.
- **Monitoring Clients**: Collect data for monitoring.
- **Load Balancer (HAproxy)**: Terminates SSL, can be a security risk.
- **MySQL Servers**: Potential issues with write capacity and uniformity.
- **Servers**: Similar components can lead to homogeneity issues.

Issues:
- SSL termination at load balancer poses security risks
- Single MySQL server for writes creates bottleneck
- Uniform server components may lead to scaling issues
