Task 3: Scale Up

Description
This advanced task focuses on scaling up the web infrastructure by splitting
components (web server, application server, database) onto their own servers and
configuring a load balancer (HAproxy) cluster for high availability.
Requirements
• 1 server
• 1 load-balancer (HAproxy) configured as a cluster with the other one
• Split components (web server, application server, database) with their own
server

Specifics of the Infrastructure
• Server: The additional server is added to distribute the workload across
different components.
• Load-Balancer Cluster: HAproxy is configured as a cluster to ensure high
availability and distribute incoming traffic.
• Split Components: Each component (web server, application server,
database) now resides on its own server, allowing for better resource
management and scalability.

Explanations
• Server Addition: Adding another server allows for better scalability and
resource management. It ensures that each component has dedicated
resources.
• Load-Balancer Cluster: Clustering HAproxy provides redundancy and fault
tolerance. If one load balancer fails, the other can take over seamlessly.
• Split Components: Splitting components onto separate servers improves
performance and allows for easier scaling. For example, if the database server
needs more resources, it can be scaled independently without affecting other
components.
