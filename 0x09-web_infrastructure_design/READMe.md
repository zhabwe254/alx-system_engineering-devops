Web Infrastructure Design Project
This project focuses on designing and implementing various web infrastructure setups for hosting the fictional website www.foobar.com. The project is structured into three tasks, each representing a different level of complexity in web infrastructure design.

Project Structure
The project is organized into three tasks, each located in their respective directories within this repository:

Task 0: Simple Web Stack

Implements a basic web infrastructure using a LAMP stack.
Components include 1 server, 1 web server (Nginx), 1 application server, 1 database (MySQL), and the necessary configurations.

Task 1: Distributed Web Infrastructure

Designs a three-server web infrastructure with load balancing for www.foobar.com.
Components include 2 servers, 1 web server (Nginx), 1 application server, 1 load balancer (HAproxy), 1 database (MySQL), and the necessary configurations.
Task 2: Secured and Monitored Web Infrastructure

Enhances the web infrastructure from Task 1 with security measures and monitoring.
Components include 3 firewalls, SSL certificate for HTTPS, 3 monitoring clients, and the necessary configurations.

Task 3: Scale Up (Advanced)

Scales up the web infrastructure by splitting components onto separate servers and configuring a load balancer cluster.
Components include 1 server, 1 load-balancer (HAproxy) cluster, and split components (web server, application server, database).

Each task comes with specific requirements, including whiteboard diagram explanations, infrastructure explanations, identified issues, and URLs for GitHub repository and task directories.
