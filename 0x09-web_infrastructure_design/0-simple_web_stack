Task 0: Simple Web Stack

Description:
This project implements a simple web infrastructure using a LAMP stack.

Components:
- 1 server
- 1 web server (Nginx)
- 1 application server
- 1 application files (code base)
- 1 database (MySQL)
- 1 domain name foobar.com configured with a www record pointing to server IP 8.8.8.8

Explanations:
- **Server**: Provides hosting for all components.
- **Domain Name**: Maps human-readable domain (foobar.com) to server IP.
- **www DNS Record**: Points the domain to the web server.
- **Web Server (Nginx)**: Handles HTTP requests and serves static content.
- **Application Server**: Executes dynamic code and interacts with the database.
- **Database (MySQL)**: Stores website data.

Issues:
- Single Point of Failure (SPOF)
- Downtime during maintenance
- Limited scalability with increased traffic
