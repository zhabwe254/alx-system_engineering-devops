# Network Security Projects

This repository contains scripts and instructions for two network security projects focusing on different attack scenarios:

1. **ARP Spoofing and Sniffing Unencrypted Traffic**
2. **Dictionary Attack**

## Project Descriptions

### 1. ARP Spoofing and Sniffing Unencrypted Traffic

In this project, we explore the concept of intercepting unencrypted network traffic through ARP spoofing and packet sniffing. We simulate a scenario where an attacker intercepts traffic between a client and an email server that uses unencrypted communication (telnet). The goal is to sniff the network traffic and extract sensitive information, such as passwords, from the intercepted data.

#### Scripts and Files:
- `user_authenticating_into_server`: A script simulating the telnet authentication process with an email server. This script mimics the authentication steps and sends an email using telnet to a server (simulated). The goal is to sniff the network traffic and extract the password.
  
#### Instructions:
1. Download and make the `user_authenticating_into_server` script executable.
2. Execute the script locally on an Ubuntu or Linux machine.
3. Use `tcpdump` to sniff the network traffic during the script execution.
4. Extract the password from the `tcpdump` output (encoded in Base64).
5. Paste the found password in the answer file.

### 2. Dictionary Attack

This project involves performing a dictionary attack on an SSH account using the Hydra tool. A dictionary attack is a method of breaking into a password-protected system by systematically entering every word in a dictionary as a password. We use a Docker container running an SSH service for this attack scenario.

#### Instructions:
1. Install Docker on your Ubuntu machine.
2. Pull and run the Docker image `sylvainkalache/264-1`.
3. Obtain or create a password dictionary.
4. Install `hydra` on your system.
5. Use `hydra` to perform a brute-force dictionary attack on the SSH account.
6. Wait for the attack tofinish and find the password.
7. Paste the found password in the answer file.
